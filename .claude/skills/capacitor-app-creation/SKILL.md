# Capacitor App Creation

Create a new Capacitor app from scratch, including project scaffolding, platform setup, and optional integrations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 22+** installed. Verify with `node --version`.
2. For **iOS**: macOS with Xcode 26.0+ installed. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`.
3. For **Android**: Android Studio 2025.2.1+ installed with Android SDK (API 24+).

## Agent Behavior

- **Guide step-by-step.** Walk the user through the process one step at a time. Never present multiple unrelated questions at once.
- **One decision at a time.** When a step requires user input, ask that single question, wait for the answer, then continue.
- **Present clear options.** Provide concrete choices (e.g., "Do you want to add the iOS platform? (yes/no)") instead of open-ended questions.

## Procedures

### Step 1: Check for Ionic Framework

**Before** creating the app, ask the user:

> Do you want to use the Ionic Framework for UI components and theming? (yes/no)

If the user answers **yes**, stop this skill and switch to the **`ionic-app-creation`** skill instead. If **no**, continue with Step 2.

### Step 2: Create the Web App

Ask the user which web framework they want to use. Present these options:

1. **Angular**
2. **React**
3. **Vue**
4. **None** (vanilla JS/TS or existing web app)

Based on the selection, scaffold the web project:

#### Angular

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
cd my-app
```

The default web asset directory for Angular is `dist/my-app/browser`. Adjust the directory name based on the actual project name.

#### React

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
```

The default web asset directory for React (Vite) is `dist`.

#### Vue

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template vue-ts
cd my-app
npm install
```

The default web asset directory for Vue (Vite) is `dist`.

#### None (vanilla or existing web app)

If the user has an existing web app, confirm it meets these requirements:

1. A `package.json` file exists at the project root.
2. A build output directory exists (e.g., `dist`, `www`, `build`).
3. An `index.html` file exists at the root of the build output directory.
4. The `index.html` file contains a `<head>` tag (required for Capacitor plugins to work).

If the user wants a vanilla project:

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npm init -y
mkdir www
```

Then create `www/index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My App</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The web asset directory is `www`.

### Step 3: Install Capacitor

Navigate to the project root directory and install the Capacitor core packages:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core
npm install -D @capacitor/cli
```

### Step 4: Initialize Capacitor

Run the Capacitor init command with the app name, app ID, and web asset directory:

```bash
npx cap init <appName> <appID> --web-dir <webDir>
```

- **`<appName>`**: Ask the user for the display name of the app (e.g., `"My App"`).
- **`<appID>`**: Ask the user for the app ID in reverse-domain format (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).
- **`<webDir>`**: Use the web asset directory determined in Step 2 (e.g., `dist`, `www`, `dist/my-app/browser`).

This creates a `capacitor.config.ts` file in the project root.

### Step 5: Build the Web App

Before adding native platforms, build the web app so the output directory exists:

#### Angular

```bash
ng build
```

#### React / Vue (Vite)

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Vanilla

No build step needed if using a static `www/` directory.

### Step 6: Add Native Platforms

Ask the user which platforms to add:

> Which platforms do you want to add? (android/ios/both)

#### Add Android

```bash
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
```

This creates the `android/` directory with a native Android project.

#### Add iOS

```bash
npm install @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios
```

This creates the `ios/` directory with a native iOS project. By default, Capacitor 8 uses Swift Package Manager (SPM) for iOS dependency management.

### Step 7: Sync the Project

Sync the web assets and native dependencies:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

This copies the built web assets into each native platform project and installs native dependencies (Gradle for Android, SPM for iOS).

### Step 8: Run the App

Run the app on a connected device or emulator/simulator:

#### Android

```bash
npx cap run android
```

This prompts for a target device (emulator or physical device).

#### iOS

```bash
npx cap run ios
```

This prompts for a target simulator or physical device.

### Step 9: Post-Creation Options

After the app is running, ask the user:

> Do you want to set up Live Updates for over-the-air updates? (yes/no)

If **yes**, refer the user to the **`capawesome-cloud`** skill for live update setup.

Then ask:

> Do you want to set up CI/CD for native builds and app store publishing? (yes/no)

If **yes**, refer the user to the **`capawesome-cloud`** skill for CI/CD setup.

## Error Handling

- **`npx cap init` fails with "already initialized"**: A `capacitor.config.ts` or `capacitor.config.json` file already exists. The project is already a Capacitor project. Delete the existing config file if re-initialization is intended.
- **`npx cap add` fails with "platform already exists"**: The `android/` or `ios/` directory already exists. Remove the directory first: `rm -rf android` or `rm -rf ios`, then re-run `npx cap add`.
- **`npx cap sync` fails with "could not find the web assets directory"**: The web app has not been built yet, or the `webDir` in `capacitor.config.ts` points to a non-existent directory. Run the web app build command first (e.g., `npm run build`, `ng build`).
- **iOS build fails with "no such module"**: Run `npx cap sync ios` to ensure SPM dependencies are resolved.
- **Android build fails with SDK errors**: Verify that Android SDK is installed and `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable is set. Open Android Studio SDK Manager to install missing SDK versions.
- **`index.html` missing `<head>` tag**: Capacitor plugins inject scripts into the `<head>` tag. Ensure the `index.html` in the web asset directory contains a `<head>` element.
