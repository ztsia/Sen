# Handoff

## Where things stand (13 Oct)

**B04 and its review fixes are merged** (ztsia/Sen#11, ztsia/Sen#12, D129's size hierarchy).
On the phone the owner found the main tabs fine, but most other screens plain lists of text, where
facts and actions look alike. **D130 decides the redesign:** calm, card-based screens.
Its brief is `docs/briefs/B04-redesign.md`, branch `B04/redesign`, PR *B04 · Redesign*.
**B05** (`docs/briefs/B05-server.md`) waits until it's merged.

**Phases 1 and 2 are done and pushed** (13 Oct). D130's blocks, `patterns.md` §7, and every screen
rebuilt in batches A–E; `SettingsRow` and `DetailPage` are gone. `apps/web/scripts/shots.mjs` takes
screenshots. A full e2e run (148 failures, about 21 distinct tests) found real product bugs, now
fixed: avatar contrast, unnamed progress bars, the pager's focus, stat tiles truncating, and two
disclosures whose 48 px extension covered the Back button. The rest are tests on old wording.

**In progress:** a Haiku agent (high effort) updating the e2e tests to the redesign, with a full
run at `E2E_LOOKS=minted,copper` at the end. If this session ends first, re-run it from its list in
the session's last message or from the run's failures.

### What to do next
1. Review the e2e diff and commit; fix any product finding it reports yourself.
2. Haiku screenshot sweep in all six looks, then QA (`qa` skill), then the PR *B04 · Redesign*.

### Decided with the owner (13 Oct; all recommended options taken)
- **Home fits one screen** at 390×844 by compressing: the payday plan becomes a one-line strip, the
  chart gets shorter, and Sen's note is clamped. A test asserts no scroll.
- **Insights is one card at a time:** sideways swipe with named steps on top.
- **Order:** phase 1 reference screens checked on the phone, then the batches.
- **This redesign comes before B05,** on its own branch.
- **48 px stays the touch target**, invisible; what's drawn follows D129's levels. Review's answer
  chips are still 40 px Toggles: make them `chip` size.
- **The owner asked for the screens they didn't mention too:** all are in the brief's table.
- **The new-look reveal's animation is B14's** (`patterns.md` §9). Here only its card follows D130;
  the skeleton keeps a still placeholder.

### Open with the owner
- `claude_skills` branch `workflow/brain-and-cards` (D130's uiux rules, D131's model principle, the
  implementer on Haiku at high) is pushed; the owner opens or asks for its PR.

## Don't argue again
- D129's levels and the 48 px target rule; D130's card-based structure; D131, Opus decides and briefs
  completely, Haiku at high by default (owner's calls).
- Deploys only by merge (D122); the review build follows the `review` branch (D115).
